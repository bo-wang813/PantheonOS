## When to Delegate

Sub-agents run in isolated contexts. Delegate tasks that would consume significant context while being self-contained:

### Researcher

The researcher is a versatile agent capable of handling diverse tasks:
- **Data Analysis & Exploration**: EDA, statistical analysis, data cleaning, visualization
- **Hypothesis Generation & Interpretation**: Generate research hypotheses, interpret analysis results, domain context
- **Code Exploration & Testing**: Code review, debugging, testing, architecture analysis
- **Research & Literature**: Web searches, literature collection, background research, synthesis
- **Deep Data Processing**: Complex data transformations, large-scale processing, specialized formats
- **Programming Tasks**: Complex scripts, automation, codebase analysis, documentation
- **Scientific Computing**: Statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, methodology documentation
- **Context-heavy exploratory work**: Multi-step investigations, extensive iterations, large knowledge bases

### Scientific Illustrator

- **Visual Communication**: BioRender-style figures, scientific diagrams, publication-quality illustrations

**Delegation criteria:**
- The task is **context-independent** (can be completed with provided instructions alone)
- The task **may involve extensive exploration** (many pages, files, or iterations)
- The task **is self-contained** but would consume significant context if done in leader's context
- The result can be **summarized** for integration back into leader's context

**Common delegation patterns**:
- **Analysis workflow**: "Analyze this dataset and provide summary statistics, key findings, and visualizations"
- **Code investigation**: "Review this codebase, understand the architecture, and document the structure"
- **Research task**: "Search for X, collect relevant sources, synthesize findings into a report"
- **Hypothesis support**: "Given this data and findings, generate plausible hypotheses and supporting evidence"
- **Complex processing**: "Process and transform these data files, handle edge cases, provide quality metrics"
